.**CORRECTED COMMANDS FOR COLAB:**
You were close, just needed to split the commands into separate lines and remove the backslashes (\) except where necessary for line continuation. Here are the corrected commands for Colab:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/OmegaPrimej/Nexarion-Code-base.git
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision tensorflow keras scipy plotly cufflinks openpyxl xlrd catboost lightgbm xgboost pytorch-lightning mlflow opencv-python pandas-profiling scikit-image yellowbrick imbalanced-learn transformers sentence-transformers gensim spacy nltk python-gitlab gitpython neuroevolution deep-neuroevolution meta-learn
```
Or, to make it more readable:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/OmegaPrimej/Nexarion-Code-base.git
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install \
  pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn \
  torch torchvision tensorflow keras scipy plotly \
  cufflinks openpyxl xlrd catboost lightgbm xgboost \
  pytorch-lightning mlflow opencv-python pandas-profiling \
  scikit-image yellowbrick imbalanced-learn transformers \
  sentence-transformers gensim spacy nltk python-gitlab \
  gitpython neuroevolution deep-neuroevolution meta-learn
```
Run these commands in your Colab notebook, and it should work as expected!
